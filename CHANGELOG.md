# Changelog

## v0.1.26

- Clarified that recommendation detail tokens can be reused for event context and application form reads until they expire.
- Aligned agent guidance with direct `application form --event-url` and `--event-id` lookups.

## v0.1.25

- Renamed the public GitHub repository and package metadata from onepilot-skill to onepilot-cli.
- Kept the `onepilot-agent` command and `SKILL.md` adapter contract stable for existing agent integrations.

## v0.1.19-alpha

- Removed retired non-event featured recommendation data and guidance.
- Updated featured resource instructions so agents do not fill missing matches with removed service or matching recommendations.

## v0.1.18-alpha

- Added the versioned activity matching request contract with structured taxonomy IDs, date ranges and hard `must`/`exclude` constraints.
- Added an explicit trust boundary for event titles, summaries, evidence and source content.
- Kept free-form query text as fallback context instead of expanding runtime alias lists.
- Added reviewed intent few-shots for negation, soft implications, specific AI topic precedence, and commonly confused activity semantics.

## v0.1.17-alpha

- Added direct OnePilot event URL/id lookup for `application form`, so agents can fetch a known event's hosted application form without spending recommendation quota.
- Documented that known OnePilot event registration should use `--event-url` or `--event-id` first, and only use `detailToken` for recommendation results.
- Added clearer error handling for missing, ambiguous, or invalid application form event references.

## v0.1.16-alpha

- Added the internal application submit attempt quota to local status policy output and docs.
- Supports the production migration that grants `application:submit` to existing active agent tokens.

## v0.1.15-alpha

- Added OnePilot-hosted internal event application flow for agents: fetch form fields, draft answers from memory, require user confirmation, and submit structured answers.

## v0.1.13-alpha

- Hardened recommendation and event-context answer guidance so agents prioritize title, date, district, venue, reason, and OnePilot URL over noisy summaries.
- Added stdin-based JSON options for PowerShell-friendly memory, feedback, and issue metadata workflows.
- Tightened update/install safety by trusting verified package hosts and refusing unverified fallback packages by default.
- Documented issue report daily limits in local status and policy output.

## v0.1.4-alpha
